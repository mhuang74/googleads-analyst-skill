### Identifying Potential Causes

Use this comprehensive diagnostic guide to identify root causes of performance changes.

#### High Costs Without Conversion Improvement

**Symptom**: Cost increased >15%, but conversions flat or declining

**Primary Causes to Investigate:**

1. **Increased Auction Competition**
   - **Evidence**: Average CPC increased significantly, impression share may have decreased
   - **Check**: Run auction insights report to see competitor changes
   - **Action**: Improve quality score, adjust bids, or shift budget to less competitive times/locations

2. **Broader Targeting Capturing Less Qualified Traffic**
   - **Evidence**: Impressions increased substantially, CTR declined, conversion rate declined
   - **Check**: Review search terms (if Search), audience targeting changes, location performance
   - **Action**: Add negative keywords, tighten audience targeting, exclude poor-performing locations

3. **Bidding Strategy Too Aggressive**
   - **Evidence**: CPC increased but conversion volume didn't improve
   - **Check**: Recent bid strategy changes, target CPA/ROAS settings
   - **Action**: Reduce bid targets, switch from Maximize Conversions to Target CPA

4. **Ad Fatigue Increasing Costs**

4. **Targeting Narrowed**
   - **Evidence**: Recent targeting changes (keywords paused, audiences removed)
   - **Check**: Change history, active vs paused entities
   - **Action**: Re-enable if performance warrants, or expand to similar audiences

5. **Seasonal Demand Decline**
   - **Evidence**: Declining across industry, search volume trends down
   - **Check**: Google Trends, year-over-year comparison
   - **Action**: Maintain presence at reduced spend, focus on efficiency

6. **Competitor Crowding You Out**
   - **Evidence**: Absolute top impression share loss, auction insights show new competitors
   - **Check**: Manual searches, auction insights
   - **Action**: Improve ad rank through quality and bids, find less competitive opportunities

#### Campaign-Specific Performance Max Issues

**Symptom**: Performance Max campaign efficiency declining

**Primary Causes to Investigate:**

1. **Asset Group Performance Variation**
   - **Evidence**: Cost increased, conversions not proportional
   - **Check**: Asset group performance report
   - **Action**: Pause poor-performing asset groups, expand best performers

2. **Audience Signal Drift**

   - **Check**: Audience signals, where conversions are coming from
   - **Action**: Refresh audience signals with recent converters, add negative signals

3. **Learning Phase After Changes**
   - **Evidence**: Recent changes to assets, budgets, or audiences
   - **Assessment**: May need 7-14 days to re-optimize
   - **Action**: Avoid further changes, let algorithm re-learn

4. **Budget Too Low for Automation**
   - **Evidence**: Spending <10x target CPA per day
   - **Check**: Daily budget vs target CPA ratio
   - **Action**: Increase budget or switch to manual campaigns for low-budget scenarios

5. **Campaign Cannibalization (Multiple PMax Campaigns)**
   - **Evidence**:
     - New PMax campaign launched recently
     - Existing PMax campaign suddenly gets much MUCH LOWER clicks/conversions
     - Strong inverse correlation: new campaign gains right near the date old campaign loses
     - Timing correlation is near new campaign launch date
   - **Root Cause**: Google's algorithm consolidates multiple PMax campaigns from same advertiser to the "strongest" one. Primary cause is typically:
     1. **Final URL Expansion Mismatch** (MOST COMMON): One campaign has expansion enabled, another disabled
     2. Domain/audience overlap between campaigns
     3. Algorithm choosing one campaign and suppressing others
   - **How to Diagnose**:
     ```bash
     # Check Final URL Expansion settings
     mcc-gaql --profile <profile> 'SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name, campaign.asset_automation_settings FROM campaign WHERE campaign.advertising_channel_type = "PERFORMANCE_MAX" AND campaign.status = "ENABLED"'

     # Look for "FinalUrlExpansionTextAssetAutomation:OptedIn" in output
     # If one campaign has it and another doesn't, this could be the cause for cannibalization

     # Check Final URLs for each campaign
     mcc-gaql --profile <profile> 'SELECT campaign.id, campaign.name, asset_group.id, asset_group.name, asset_group.final_urls, asset_group.final_mobile_urls FROM asset_group WHERE campaign.advertising_channel_type = "PERFORMANCE_MAX"'

     # Confirm cannibalization timing by looking at daily performance
     mcc-gaql --profile <profile> -o /tmp/pmax_daily.csv 'SELECT campaign.name, segments.date, metrics.impressions, metrics.clicks, metrics.cost_micros, metrics.conversions, metrics.conversions_value FROM campaign WHERE campaign.advertising_channel_type = "PERFORMANCE_MAX" AND segments.date DURING LAST_60_DAYS ORDER BY campaign.name, segments.date'
     ```
   - **Action**:
     1. **Option A - Align Settings**: Disable Final URL Expansion on new campaign to match old campaign
     2. **Option B - Consolidate**: Merge both campaigns into single PMax with multiple asset groups
     3. **Option C - Enable Both**: Enable expansion on old campaign (but both will still compete)
     4. **Option D - Different Domains**: Change one campaign to target different domain/subdomain
