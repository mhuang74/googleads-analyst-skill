## Contextual Analysis Rules

**Rule 1: Cost Increases Are Acceptable IF:**
- Conversions increased proportionally or more (cost efficiency maintained)
- ROAS improved or maintained (conversion value justifies spend)
- You're in growth phase and acquiring customers at acceptable CPA
- Impression share increased significantly (capturing more market)

**Example:**
- Cost +50%, Conversions +60% = ✅ GOOD (CPA improved)
- Cost +50%, Conversions +30% = ⚠️ WATCH (CPA worsened but still growing)
- Cost +50%, Conversions -10% = 🚨 CRITICAL (very bad efficiency)

**Rule 2: CTR Declines Warrant Investigation IF:**
- Impressions increased significantly (may indicate broader targeting diluting CTR)
- Cost increased without conversion improvement (paying more for worse engagement)
- CTR drop is >25% (severe performance degradation)
- Clicks decreased while impressions stayed stable (ad relevance issue)

**When CTR decline is acceptable:**
- Impression expansion with maintained conversion efficiency
- Strategic shift to awareness campaigns
- Testing new audiences (expected learning period)

**Rule 3: Conversion Rate Changes Should Consider:**
- **Sample size**: Changes with <50 clicks may not be statistically significant
- **Click volume**: If clicks dropped 80%, conversion rate is less reliable
- **CPA trends**: Sometimes lower conversion rate with lower CPA is better
- **Total conversion volume**: Absolute conversions matter more than rate

**Rule 4: Impression Changes Signal:**
- **Large increase (>50%)**: Budget increase, expanded targeting, or increased competition
- **Large decrease (>50%)**: Budget cuts, narrowed targeting, or lost ad rank
- **Stable impressions with CTR drop**: Ad creative fatigue or competitive ad improvements
- **Stable impressions with cost increase**: CPC inflation (check avg CPC)

**Rule 5: Zero Conversions Pattern Analysis:**

If a campaign has zero conversions in current period:
1. Check if it had conversions in previous period (recent decline vs ongoing issue)
2. Verify conversion tracking is working (compare with other campaigns)
3. Assess if campaign objective aligns with conversion tracking (blog vs sales)
4. Calculate clicks threshold for statistical significance (need ~30+ clicks usually)
